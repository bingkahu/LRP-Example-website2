                <p>The admissions process at Lift Richmond Park is governed by our admissions policy, which complies with the national School Admissions Code. For Year 7 entry, parents must apply through their local authority's common application form by the specified deadline, typically October 31st for the following September intake.</p>
                <p>Our oversubscription criteria are applied when there are more applications than places available. Priority is given to: 1. Looked-after children and previously looked-after children. 2. Children with exceptional medical or social needs. 3. Siblings of current students. 4. Children of staff members. 5. Distance from the school.</p>
                <p>For in-year admissions, applications are made directly to the school. We assess availability in the relevant year group and apply the same oversubscription criteria if necessary. Waiting lists are maintained for one academic year, and positions are updated regularly.</p>
                <p>Sixth Form admissions require a minimum of five GCSEs at grade 5 or above, including English and Mathematics. Specific subjects may have higher requirements. The application process includes submitting predicted grades, a personal statement, and attending an advisory meeting to discuss options.</p>
                <p>We are committed to fair access and do not discriminate based on race, religion, or background. Appeals for unsuccessful applications can be made to an independent panel. We provide support for families throughout the process, including information sessions and individual consultations.</p>
                <p>Our induction programs for new students ensure a smooth transition, with buddy systems and orientation days. We also offer support for students with special needs during admissions, working closely with primary schools and external agencies.</p>
                <p>For more information or to arrange a visit, please contact our admissions team. We look forward to welcoming new members to our Lift Richmond Park family.</p>
